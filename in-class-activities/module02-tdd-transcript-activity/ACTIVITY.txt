2. The testable behaviors are:
- addGrade() should add a CourseGrade to the Transcript of the Student
- addGrade() should throw an exception if the Student is not in the database
- addGrade() should throw an exception if the Course doesn't match the Course of the CourseGrade
- if a CourseGrade already exists, addGrade() updates the CourseGrade

3. One exceptional behavior is when a a CourseGrade already exists, it is updated by addGrade().
Another exceptional behavior is the decision to return exceptions when invalid parameters are given (versus returning something).
